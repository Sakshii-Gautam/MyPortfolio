          Hello stranger! ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sakshi and I am a frontend web
          developer, who loves the challenge of turning complex designs into
          reality. With a commitment to clean code and attention to detail, I'm
          always up for a challenge and eager to learn new skills and
          technologies along the way while making the web a more welcoming and
          user-friendly place.
